# Recoil Deep Dive

In Recoil, you can handle asynchronous queries using selectors. A selector can derive state from atoms or other selectors, and it can perform asynchronous operations such as fetching data from an API. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to implement async queries in Recoil:

1. **Define an atom**: Create an atom to hold the basic state, such as the parameters for the query.

2. **Create an asynchronous selector**: Use a selector to fetch data asynchronously. The selector can return a Promise, which Recoil will handle internally to manage the loading and error states.

ðŸ’¡ When we are using selectors we should set them also otherwise they give Errors,

Example:

```js

export const NotificationSelector=selector({
    key:'NotificationSelector',
    get:({get})=>{
        const list=get(NotificationAtom);
        return list
    },
    set: ({ set }, newValue) => {
      set(NotificationAtom, newValue);
    }
})
```
## Async DB Queries
 With Selectors

<aside>   
    ðŸ’¡ Selectors ka istemaal asynchronous data ko Recoil data-flow graph mein incorporate karne ke liye kiya ja sakta hai, lekin isme kuch important cheezein dhyaan mein rakhni chahiye:
  
    1. Idempotency: Selectors ko idempotent functions ke roop mein treat karna chahiye, yani ek hi input ke liye hamesha same result dena chahiye. Yeh isliye zaroori hai kyunki selector evaluations cache ho sakti hain, restart ho sakti hain, ya multiple times execute ho sakti hain. Yeh property ensure karna zaroori hai taki aapka application predictably aur consistently kaam kare.
    2. Read-Only Data: Selectors ka istemaal general read-only DB queries ke model karne ke liye achha hai. Matlab agar aapko sirf data read karna hai aur usko display ya use karna hai bina usme changes kiye, to selectors appropriate hain.
    3. Mutable Data : Agar aap mutable data ko handle karna chahte hain, to aapko Query Refresh ka istemaal karna chahiye. Yeh mutable data ko refresh karne ke liye use hota hai.
    4. Side Effects aur State Synchronization: Agar aapko mutable state ko synchronize karna hai, persist karna hai, ya koi side-effects execute karne hain, to Atom Effects API ya Recoil Sync Library ka istemaal karna chahiye. Yeh APIs aur libraries is purpose ke liye zyada suitable hain.
    
    To summarize, selectors ka istemaal aap kar sakte hain, lekin unka primary use case read-only data ke liye hai. Mutable data aur side effects ke liye aapko Query Refresh, Atom Effects API, ya Recoil Sync Library ka use karna chahiye.

    
    
## Atom Family

<aside>ðŸ’¡Used to create Dynamic atoms</aside>

In Recoil, `atomFamily` is a function that allows you to define a family of atoms with dynamic keys. This is particularly useful when you have a set of related state atoms that follow a pattern or need to be created dynamically based on some parameters or IDs. Let's delve into how `atomFamily` works and its usage in Recoil:

### What is `atomFamily`?

`atomFamily` in Recoil allows you to create a template for defining atoms that can be instantiated multiple times with different keys. Each instance of the atom (derived from `atomFamily`) can have its own distinct state and can be accessed and updated independently. This is particularly useful when you have data that is structured in a way where multiple instances need to be managed, such as a list of items with unique identifiers.

### Usage of `atomFamily`:

#### 1. Creating an `atomFamily`:

```javascript
import { atomFamily } from 'recoil';

// Define atomFamily for todo items
export const todoAtomFamily = atomFamily({
  key: 'todoAtomFamily', // Unique key for this atom family
  default: (param) => {
    // Param is used to generate unique atoms based on some identifier
    return {
      id: param,
      title: '',
      completed: false,
    };
  },
});
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **`key`**: A unique string identifier for this family of atoms.
  - **`default`**: A function that returns the default value for each instance of the atom. It takes `param` as an argument, which can be used to create atoms dynamically based on some parameter (like an ID).

#### 2. Using `atomFamily` in Components:

Once you have defined an `atomFamily`, you can use it in your components to access and update state for individual instances of the atom.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useRecoilState } from 'recoil';
import { todoAtomFamily } from './path-to-your-recoil-file';

function TodoItem({ todoId }) {
  const [todo, setTodo] = useRecoilState(todoAtomFamily(todoId));

  const toggleCompletion = () => {
    setTodo((prevTodo) => ({
      ...prevTodo,
      completed: !prevTodo.completed,
    }));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{todo.title}</h2>
      <p>Completed: {todo.completed ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
      <button onClick={toggleCompletion}>
        {todo.completed ? 'Mark as not done' : 'Mark as done'}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TodoItem;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **`useRecoilState`**: Hook to read and write a Recoil state atom's value.
  - **`todoAtomFamily(todoId)`**: Calling `todoAtomFamily` with a `todoId` parameter retrieves the specific atom instance corresponding to that `todoId`.
  - **`setTodo`**: Function to update the state of the atom instance (`todo`).

#### 3. Dynamic State Management:

With `atomFamily`, you can dynamically manage state for each instance of an atom based on parameters such as IDs, names, or any other unique identifier relevant to your application's data structure. This makes it easy to work with dynamic data sets without needing to create and manage separate atoms manually for each instance.

### Summary:

- `atomFamily` in Recoil allows you to define a template for creating multiple instances of atoms.
- Each instance can have its own distinct state and can be accessed and updated independently.
- Useful for managing dynamic data structures where you need to create and manage state for multiple instances based on unique identifiers.

By leveraging `atomFamily` in Recoil, you can maintain clean and efficient state management in your React applications, especially when dealing with complex or dynamic data structures that require multiple instances of state atoms.

## Selector Family
In Recoil, `selectorFamily` is a function similar to `atomFamily`, but instead of managing state atoms, it manages selectors. Just like `atomFamily`, `selectorFamily` allows you to define a template for creating multiple instances of selectors with dynamic keys or parameters. This is particularly useful when you have a set of related selectors that need to compute derived state based on different inputs or identifiers.

### Usage of `selectorFamily`:

#### 1. Creating a `selectorFamily`:

```javascript
import { selectorFamily } from 'recoil';

// Define selectorFamily for fetching todo items based on IDs
export const todoSelectorFamily = selectorFamily({
  key: 'todoSelectorFamily', // Unique key for this family of selectors
  get: (todoId) => ({ get }) => {
    // The get function is passed as an argument to the selector
    const todos = get(todoListState); // Assuming todoListState is a Recoil atom
    return todos.find(todo => todo.id === todoId) || null;
  },
});
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **`key`**: A unique string identifier for this family of selectors.
  - **`get`**: A function that returns the selector's value based on `todoId`. It receives a `get` parameter that allows it to read other Recoil values (like atoms).

#### 2. Using `selectorFamily` in Components:

Once you have defined a `selectorFamily`, you can use it in your components to access derived state based on different parameters.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useRecoilValue } from 'recoil';
import { todoSelectorFamily } from './path-to-your-recoil-file';

function TodoItem({ todoId }) {
  const todo = useRecoilValue(todoSelectorFamily(todoId));

  if (!todo) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>; // Handle loading state if todo is not available
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{todo.title}</h2>
      <p>Completed: {todo.completed ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TodoItem;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **`useRecoilValue`**: Hook to read the value of a Recoil selector.
  - **`todoSelectorFamily(todoId)`**: Calling `todoSelectorFamily` with a `todoId` parameter retrieves the specific selector instance corresponding to that `todoId`.
  - **Derived State**: The selector (`todoSelectorFamily`) computes and returns derived state based on the `todoId`.

#### 3. Dynamic State Computation:

With `selectorFamily`, you can dynamically compute and manage derived state for each instance of a selector based on parameters such as IDs, names, or any other unique identifiers relevant to your application's data structure. This allows you to efficiently compute and retrieve data that depends on dynamic inputs or conditions.

### Summary:

- **`selectorFamily`** in Recoil allows you to define a template for creating multiple instances of selectors.
- Each instance computes and returns derived state based on dynamic inputs or parameters.
- Useful for managing and computing derived state that depends on dynamic data or conditions in your application.

By using `selectorFamily` in Recoil, you can implement efficient and scalable state management solutions, especially when dealing with complex or dynamic data structures that require derived state computation based on various parameters.
